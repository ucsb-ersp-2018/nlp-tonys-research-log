## Week 2 (1/14-1/20)

### January 16, Wednesday (2 hours)
- [x] Meet with May, Andrew, and Shirlyn to discuss potential paths for research
- [x] Read a little about long short-term memory models for machine learning

Key Takeaways from Meeting -- 3 possible ideas
 1. Debiasing inputs on the fly, automatically (using LSTMs)
   * Use LSTMs to know how biased the previous X number of inputs are
   * If the input data is too biased in one direction, inject data that would balance it out, possibly using coreference resolution and gender swapping
 2. Implicit hate speech tweet detection
   * Try to tease out gender bias from sentences while avoiding confounding variables
   * A lot of work has been in *explicit* hate speech detection, but so far implicit hate speech detection has been difficult
 3. Causal graph debiasing
   *
